1) npm init
2) npm install -D parcel 
3) npm i react
4) npm i react-dom
5) Code setup

root.render(element);

6) npx parcel index.html
7) HMR - Hot Module Reload --> Due to this parcel refreshes the browser if any changes done in code 
8) Script type should be module as we are exporting the library files from node module. Example below :-
    <script type="module" src="App.js"></script>
9) File watcher algorithm --> It keeps track of any changes done in any file and refreshes the page.
10) Parcel jobs behind the scene are given below :-
    --> Creates a Server (http://localhost:1234/)
    --> HMR - Hot Module Replacement --> Due to this parcel refreshes the browser if any changes done in code
    --> File watcher algorithm keeps track of any changes done in any file and refreshes the page.
    --> Bundling the code for production ready code
    --> Minify (On Production Environment)
    --> Cleaning all unwanted code like console.log.
        To remove console.log install(npm install babel-plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev)
        // with options --> create .babelrc file and add below code in that file
        {
        "plugins": [["transform-remove-console", { "exclude": ["error", "warn"] }]]
        }
    --> Manages Dev and Production Build & it is super fast build algorithm 
    --> It optimises images and videos 
    --> Caching while Development 
    --> It compresses files. 
    --> Compatible with older versions of Browsers (It adds polyfill)
    --> It help enabling HHTPS on DEV environment (npx parcel index.html --https)
    --> If we run/build 2 project simultanisously then parcel auto manages ports for 2 projects 
    --> Parcel-Cache should be put in git ignore 
    --> Consistent Hashing Alorithm 
    --> Parcel is Zero Config bundler 
    --> Transitive Dependencies (One package is dependent on another and another is dependent on other)
    --> Tree Shaking --> Removes all unwanted code


11) https://browserslist.dev/?q=bGFzdCAyIHZlcnNpb25z --> Contains all supported browsers and versions 
12) React Reconciliation  --> If any new html elements is introduces and if it does not have key, 
    react takes lots of time to re-render DOM.
    But if we have specific and unique key attached to html element 
    then it just re-render it withput updating whole DOM
    (Documentation - https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)
    <ul>
        <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
        <li key="2015">Duke</li>
        <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
    </ul>

13) React.createElement gives us an Object and this object is converted into HTML and it renders in DOM
14) JSX --> It is an HTML like syntax, but it is not HTML inside JavaScript. 
15) JSX code is not understood by Browser, BABEL understand and create browser readable code and then
    it is executed in Browser
16) Babel --> Is a compiler for next generation JavaScript. 
17) JSX --> Uses React.createElement --> Then it is converted to Object --> Then HTML --> Render in DOM
18) node_modules --> Also has package-lock.json file. 
    this package-lock.json contails all Transitive Dependencies 
    (One package is dependent on another and another is dependent on other)
19) React Component :--> 
    a) React Component is of two type (Functional Component & Class Based Component)
    b) Functional Component --> Name starts with the Capital Letter. Example below :-
        const HeaderComponent = () => {
        return <h1>Functional Header Component</h1>;
        };
    c) Functional Component is nothing but it it just a Functional 
    d) To render functional component we use --> root.render(<HeaderComponent />)
    e) To render react element we use -->  root.render(header). Here const header = <h1>Header</h1>  
    f) If we want to use react element inside function we can do with {} brace as below :-
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        const name = <h1>Bikash Shaw</h1>;
        const HeaderComponent = () => {
        return (
            <div>
            {name} <-- Like this 
            <h1>Functional Header Component</h1>;
            </div>
        );
        };
        root.render(<HeaderComponent />); 
    g) Component Composition --> If we want to use functional component into functional component 
       (Nested Component) 
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        const NameComponent = () => {
        return <h1>Bikash Shaw</h1>;
        };
        const HeaderComponent = () => {
        return (
            <div>
            {NameComponent()} <-- Call it as a normal function call.
            <NameComponent /> <-- Call it as JSX tag.  
            <h1>Functional Header Component</h1>;
            </div>
        );
        };
        root.render(<HeaderComponent />);    


20) {} ==> We can write any piece of JavaScript code inside curly braces
21) Is JSX mandatory --> JSX is not mandatory. 
22) Is TypeScript mandatory --> TypeScript is not mandatory
23) Is ES6 mandatory --> ES6 is not mandatory
24) React is a library and it does not restricts on any language. We can use any language.
25) JSX expression should have only one parent element.
    a) React.Fragment --> React.Fragment is a component which is exported by React library.
    b) React.Fragment --> It is like an empty tag.
    c) React.Fragment --> shorthand for React.Fragment is <> </>
    d) Can we use nested React.Fragment --> ? (Need to google it)
26) Config Driven UI -->
    a) 
27) Optional Chaining --> {Google it}
28) Props --> 
    a) Props is nothing but a properties
    b) Props is passing some data into our component
    c) Send data from Parent to Child we pass it as a PROPS
    d) 
29) Virtual DOM -->
    a) Virtual DOM is not just a concept for react only. It is used in may places, react also has virtual DOM
    b) Virtual DOM is a software engineering concept.
    c) Virtual DOM is a representation of actual DOM in our Code.
    d) Why do we need Virtual DOM ?
        Ans) We need it for re-concilliation. Reconciliation is an algorithm that react uses to {diff}
             One tree from other, to identify what needs to change and what shoul not change in DOM.
             {Key} which is unique are used for reconciliation to happen properly.
             React Fiber is a new Reconciliation Engine.
             --> Why do we not use {index} as a key ?(https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/)

30) Export Module --> 
    a) Export Default --> We can only export default only one component.
    b) Export default can we imported like --> import Header from "./components/Header"; (default import)
    c) Export (also known as named import) --> import { Header } from "./components/Header"; (Named import)
    d) If we have multiple function in one component and we want to import all the function. Below is code :-
       import * as Obj from "./components/Header";       
    e) 

31) Data Binding -->
    a) React uses One Way Data Binding
    b) State --> Every component in React maintains a STATE and we can put variable into that STATE
    c) Hook --> Is nothing but a normal function 
    d) useState() --> It creates a state variables
    e) useState() --> this function returns an array. First element of an array is "variableName", second is "setVariable"
    f) const [searchTxt] = useState(); --> This is how we create local state variables in React
    g) useState comes as (named import) in react
    h) 
32) API Calls -->
    a) fetch() --> browser API is used to call an API
    b) We will not call fetch() directly in our component, because every time if any state variable changes,
       Component get redenderd and API will be called again and again. This is bad implementation 
    c) Component gets renders 2 times, on PROPS change and on STATE change
    d) If we dont provide "dependency Array" in side useEffect then it will get call on every re render.
    e) If we dont want to call it on every re render then we pass "dependency array" in useEffect.
    f) useEffect(() => {    
        }, []); ==> here [] is a dependency array
    g) If we dont give any dependency in "dependency array" then it will get called only once after "render"
    h)     
33) Shimmer UI --> Load a blank page design before APIL call and fill data filling happens.
